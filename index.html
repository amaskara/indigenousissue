        <h1 class="headline GlowColor">Tierra y memoria</h1>
        <p>By Rodrigo Córdova Rosado</p>
        <p>
          <b class = "PowerColor">𐓰𐓘𐓲𐓘 𐓵𐓘𐓻𐓪𐓲𐓟</b>​​​​, I hear the crashing ocean in the rustling of leaves along the limbs of the ginkgo
          north of Prospect House. I hear finches chirp as the morning dew moistens my shoes as I pass Lewis Library. And
          I remember the humidity of my island and the smell of petrichor as the rain pelts my window in Forbes.&nbsp;
        </p>
      <p>
        Land and memory are a reflective combination. They have defined the Native experience on this land — now known
        as the United States — long before Jefferson inked his quill. The land we stand on was stolen from the Lenape —
        the memories ripped from it like a sapling from its roots — for us to live with the consequences. To live in
        Princeton as a member of an Indian Nation, Tribe, or “domestic dependent nation,” as the U.S. Bureau of Indian
        Affairs defines federally-recognized Native communities, is to be keenly aware of this history and the
        responsibility of the present to address the consequences of the past. It is to be aware of the exposed roots
        rotting for lack of care on the land and in our memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class = "PowerColor">I am a guest on this land.</b> I come from people who lived on Borinquén (now known as Puerto Rico) before the
        historical record begins, from people who built cities along the Middle Waters (the Mississippi River Valley),
        from people who were uprooted to Indian territory in Oklahoma, and from people who sailed the Atlantic in search
        of spices but arrived to find conquest.<b class = "PowerColor">I am 𐓷𐓘𐓻𐓘𐓻𐓟, Osage, and have arrived on this land made of soil
          foreign to me.</b> In sharing this feeling with all of our communities, we must ask: How do we grow in this
        unfamiliar place? How do we tend the roots ripped from the earth in the place we seek to grow our own?
      </p>
      <p>
        Being a part of the Indigenous community here is one of the highlights of my time at Princeton. Whether we’re
        discussing water rights in the Southwest, or the push and pull in our communities over the sacred and how it
        impacts people and projects like mountaintop telescopes, or feeling like your identity is reflected by folks in
        a new and strange place: communities have the power to build new homes. They are the mycelial network that ties
        us together. This is the ongoing project of revitalization: a reaction to the centuries of physical and cultural
        genocide that took place here. From Indigenous language courses to the engendering of Indigenous studies in
        academia, <b class = "PowerColor">we are attempting to re-seed what boarding schools, forced assimilation, land allotments, and the
        destruction of our environments took away from us.</b> And yet, we still do not have an Indigenous studies program
        at Princeton, a dedicated space for Native peoples, nor do we discuss what the purpose of a land acknowledgment
        truly is. Like many things in Native communities, perhaps these will come with time. Unfortunately, time is
        running out.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was a junior in college when Hurricane María blew through my home. The last thing my dad told me before I lost
        contact with my family for a week was “no te preocupes (not to worry), la casa está hecha de ladrillos, no de
        ramas o paja (the house is made of bricks, not sticks or straw.)” Last week we had the same conversation. Last
        week my family in Florida, land of the Seminole, Calusa, and Myaamia, was struck by such a hurricane as María.
        Last year the forests around the world burned. This year our forests have burned. <b class = "GlowColor">Will there even be a forest
          next year?</b> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Accelerating climate change poses an existential threat to land and memory, the core of who we are. Rising to
        the challenges we have been given means starting with recognition of our responsibility to the land, and each
        other. We who were born of stars that exploded billions of years ago, given form on the Earth made from that
        stardust: we are made of this land, and we must relearn how to live on it. <a
          href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/publication/PB_101.pdf">Eighty
          percent of the world’s biodiversity</a> is cared for by Indigenous communities, contained within 20 percent of
        the land, held by five percent of humanity. We have <a
          href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.1609775113">grown with the land</a> as it grew with us, and
        it is time to return the land to its caretakers. Not only because it was wantonly and savagely stolen — just
        read how Andrew Jackson’s soldiers made <a
          href="https://books.google.com/books?id=DTeDDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=skin#v=snippet&amp;q=long%20strips%20of%20skin&amp;f=false">horse
          bridle reins from Native skin</a> — but because our track record of caring for the land is a few millennia
        long. As a recent anthropology <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/sciadv.abn2927"
          target="_self">paper</a> put it, Indigenous Peoples hold essential knowledge for the conservation of our
        planet’s biodiversity, so partnership, rather than endless cycles of ecological impact studies, just might avert
        the ecological collapse ahead of us. In the rapidly changing landscape of the future, I see a need to
        interrogate what we intend to do to seek justice alongside survival.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        To walk on this campus is to know there is the potential for amazing, transformative action. It is also to know
        these walkways cover the land and the blood spilled on it. To hold both of these truths is the responsibility of
        our communities. To see land and memory intertwined, the physical world and our experience of it, is perhaps one
        of the greatest lessons my communities have taught me. It guides my path in wanting to research the cosmic past
        and our human perception of it, and it reminds me how unlikely I was to be the one to ask these questions.
      </p>

        On rainy days I remember afternoons at my grandparents’ watching “Plaza Sésamo” — Big Bird’s role is played by a
        colorful parrot named Abelardo. The campus leaves are turning the color of the warm sunset I watched over the
        ocean after eating some of the day’s catch with a side of coconut arepas from Don Candi in Fajardo, Puerto Rico.
        On cloudless nights we observe planets at the Peyton Hall telescope, almost like the moments back home, after I
        sat on a beach and saw the Milky Way for the first time. The water was cool and the rising Moon was yellow.

      <p>
        To commemorate this Indigeous Peoples Day, The Daily Princetonian has worked to amplify the voices and
        experiences of Indiegenous peoples on our campus. This project could not possibly exhaust the stories of
        Native peoples at Princeton, nor does it aim to. Instead it marks a re-commitment by the ‘Prince’ to welcome
        Native and Indigenous Princetonians into our paper, on their own terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The opening words of this project are written in Osage; Graduate student Rodrigo Córdova Rosado’s essay is
        grounded in a Native language that is undergoing revival. This project features profiles of Gustavo
        Blanco-Quiroga ’25 and Jessica Lambert ’22, two Indigenous students who have worked to innovatively use
        University resources to serve their own Native communities. And in a special podcast, the ‘Prince’ highlights
        the history of Dr. Alfonso Ortiz, an anthropologist at Princeton in the 1970s whose study of his own community
        — the Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo — and staunch advocacy for Indigenous scholarship continues to have effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through powerful opinion essays that grapple with the legacy of Princeton-affiliated Rev. Sheldon Jackson and
        exploitative tourism to Hawai’i, a photo essay featuring perspectives of members of Natives at Princeton, and
        interviews with Native scholars, artists, activists, and community leaders, we hope to spark conversations
        that go far beyond the confines of this brief web project.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope that this effort may be one of many: Each story we are honored to feature here may lay the groundwork
        for another yet to be told.

      <h1 class="headline">That’s why I’m here at Princeton’: Gustavo Blanco-Quiroga ’25 serves home community in
        Bolivia through Pace Center grant</h1>
      <p class="yellow">By Sydney Eck</p>
      <p>
        For Gustavo Blanco-Quiroga ’25, a Princeton education presents first and foremost an opportunity: “I wanted to
        redirect the privilege and education I have to my community.”&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        The John H. Pace Jr. ’39 Center for Civil Engagement’s Projects for Peace program <a
          href="https://pace.princeton.edu/get-involved/pace-center-programs/projects-peace" target="_self">awards
          $10,000</a> to University undergraduates to “implement an innovative service project anywhere in the world —
        or right in their own backyard.” The award, for Blanco-Quiroga, became another key chance to give back to his
        Indigenous community back home in Bolivia.

      <p>
        “I am from the Aymara Indigenous community, which is one of 36 communities we have in Bolivia. It’s a beautiful
        community where we practice reciprocity and service,” he said in an interview with The Daily Princetonian.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeking to emulate that tradition of “reciprocity and service” this past summer, Blanco-Quiroga used the
        Projects for Peace funding to start the <a href="https://pace.princeton.edu/news/2022/projects-peace-22"
          target="_blank">Chacha Emprende Project</a>, a two-pronged approach to bringing education and resources back
        to his community.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “The project is based on workshops for gender equality and supporting entrepreneurship for Indigenous leaders,”
        Blanco-Quiroga explained.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Stephanie Guarachi, a Bolivian youth mentor and a friend of Blanco-Quiroga’s, helped develop the original
        concept for the project.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “We were really looking at these big issues and how the project could help,” she told the ‘Prince.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The Chacha Emprende Project addressed the issue of violence against women in Bolivia by hosting “new
        masculinity” workshops for male Indigenous community leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We wanted to create a project that not only attacked the problem of gender inequity but addressed the ones who
        produce it, which is often men,” Blanco-Quiroga said.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The participants are all leaders within their Indigenous communities,” he explained. “I think after having been
        in these workshops they have already started changing their behaviors. And they will inspire others.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Pace Center Assistant Director for Engaged Pedagogy Matt Lynn worked with Blanco-Quiroga to support him as he
        organized and executed the project. When discussing Blanco-Quiroga’s project, Lynn told the ‘Prince’ that “some
        of the most pressing issues that I think Indigenous communities in Bolivia face are those social forces that
        Gustavo’s project really dug into, such as violence that is rooted in colonial structures of gender.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Working with young men specifically is quite revolutionary for Bolivia,” said Lynn, who previously lived in
        Bolivia for 15 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second part of the Chacha Emprende Project focused on developing and financing entrepreneurship projects for
        Indigenous leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Communities in Latin America have been hit very hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and Bolivia is trying to recover
        [its] economy,” Blanco-Quiroga said. “That’s why we have that entrepreneurship piece.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I am so proud of everything they did,” Guarachi said when discussing the entrepreneurship initiatives that were
        developed and ultimately funded through the Chacha Emprende Project.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It was a challenge to pick which projects would receive funding,” Blanco-Quiroga said. “We got so many really
        amazing proposals.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The projects that were selected by Blanco-Quiroga and a team of judges all aim to serve Indigenous communities
        in Bolivia. One initiative is dedicated to providing marketing services in Indigenous languages in addition to
        Spanish. Another initiative works with Indigenous artisans to advertise and sell their products at a fair price
        in cities.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “Gustavo did a really good job identifying a community need in his own context, in his own community,” Lynn
        said. “I don’t think there was anything major that he didn’t contemplate before going down there because he knew
        the context so well. He knew the needs so well.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Guarachi agreed: “Gustavo was the right person to plan this project for his community.”&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        To Guarachi, Blanco-Quiroga’s dedication to his home community felt particularly impressive because of her own
        experience with many young Bolivians who feel separated from their history and culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I’m part of the second or third generation to live in the city. Sometimes I feel like I am Bolivian by
        nationality but not by culture,” she said. “I think something a lot of people feel about their history and their
        ancestors is this idea of ‘you are not entirely, but you are still.’ Gustavo brought that experience of being in
        the Indigenous community.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “This project, though it was a lot of work, has filled me with energy,” Blanco-Quiroga said. “Seeing how there
        are so many talented young people in Bolivia has inspired me to keep working to help them after I graduate from
        Princeton.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Blanco-Quiroga discussed how communities at Princeton have further shaped his views on Indigenous rights issues
        and supported him in his advocacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        “A big part of my freshman experience was with <a
          href="https://indigenous.princeton.edu/community/natives-princeton">Natives at Princeton</a>. I think it is
        such a beautiful community that I am very happy to be a part of,” Blanco-Quiroga said. “To get to meet other
        people from different Indigenous communities made me feel more welcome on campus.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Lynn reflected on Blanco-Quiroga’s advocacy initiatives beyond being a Projects for Peace winner.
      </p>
      <p>
        “From the moment I met him, there was just this expression of ‘I’m dedicated to working within my community and
        that’s why I’m here at Princeton.’ I am just blown away every time I speak to him,” he said. “His humility and
        his ability to connect with many people around an issue he is dedicated to is so incredible.”
      </p>

        Blanco-Quiroga reiterated that he sees the Chacha Emprende Project as a starting point for more work to be done
        in his community and within the University.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “There is still so much work to do, and I feel I can contribute to that,” he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Princeton is investing in Indigenous studies and Indigenous students,” Lynn said. “I am excited to see that
        commitment deepen and grow. There are so many possibilities to engage with Indigenous rights and Indigenous
        students, faculty, and staff that would be attuned to the rights and needs of Indigenous people and communities
        right here in New Jersey, such as the Ramapough and Lenape.”&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Lynn went on to discuss his time living in Bolivia, comparing community organizing there with Indigenous
        advocacy in the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I think that it’s important to note that there are 36 languages spoken in Bolivia. They are all recognized
        officially in the constitution,” Lynn said. “Not that everything is perfect in Bolivia, of course, but I think
        the West and the United States have a lot to learn from Bolivia in terms of how Indigenous frameworks can be
        part of our national story moving forward.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In Lynn’s view, Blanco-Quiroga’s project has helped further that goal by contributing to a culture of service at
        Princeton that is based on understanding and true community needs.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “Gustavo worked towards relationship building and community engagement in a way that expressed his commitment to
        his own community and his own reality,” he said. “That’s what we hope to see more of at the Pace Center:
        students speaking and working from their own positionalities. I think we can all engage that way.”

            <strong>The Daily Princetonian:</strong> Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Noah Collins:</strong> I’m from Claremore, Oklahoma and the Cherokee reservation. I am an enrolled
            citizen of the Cherokee Nation. I’m also White Mountain Apache Tribe. I’m a geneticist by training, but I am
            a graduate student in the anthropology department. I study bioethics, genomics, and Indigenous communities —
            Indigenous inclusion in science in general and the intersection between pharmaceuticals and genetics.

        <strong>DP:</strong> What were some moments when you felt like your Native identity stood out the most?
      </p>
      <p class="interview-response">
        <strong>NC:</strong> It’s always present to me that I am Indigenous. A lot of society and a lot of my
        interactions are framed in opposition to something that is not necessarily by my choice. Being Indigenous and
        going through society, you are constantly thought of as less or incapable. I think it is a blessing to be
        Indigenous and to be in spaces that were not meant for me and to navigate them in a way that we’ve always been
        capable of doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DP:</strong> What’s a message you have for other Native students at Princeton?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NC:</strong> Be unapologetically Indigenous. I think there’s a lot of fear around being vocally
        Indigenous in classes and research in politics broadly. And we’ll never get the foothold that we need to support
        other Natives if we’re quiet when we should be supported.

      <p>
        <strong>Daily Princetonian:</strong> Can you describe your indigenous identity?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leilani Bender:</strong> I'm Native Hawaiian/Kanaka Maoli.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DP:</strong> What's the significance of your red protest t-shirt?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>LB:</strong> It refers to Mauna Kea and the plans for a thirty-meter telescope to be built on it. Mauna
        Kea (Mauna a Wakea) is linked to the name of Wakea, the father of the Hawaiian islands. Thus, it is very sacred
        and important to Hawaiian culture. Many Native Hawaiians believe that a telescope on top of Mauna Kea would
        desecrate the sacred land, especially when there have been multiple instances of mismanagement from other
        research projects on Mauna Kea, dating back to 1998. I feel like people may expect me to be in support of the
        thirty-meter telescope being built, as I am majoring in civil engineering here. However, I believe that
        respecting the land and the Earth, as well as the people who live on it, is far more important than the
        scientific discovery of faraway stars.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DP:</strong> Do you face those same dilemmas in your studies or with possible future jobs given your
        major and your connection to your indigenous culture?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>LB:</strong> I would say it’s not applicable since I want to be a teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DP:</strong> How do you connect with your Hawaiian culture, both at home and at Princeton?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>LB</strong>: Listening to Hawaiian music, playing the ukulele, and I am learning Hawaiian. The land and
        the natural world are also very important to me, and although Princeton's nature is nowhere near the same as
        Hawai'i's, I still feel connected to my ancestors when I look at the same moon and stars as they did when they
        navigated across the Pacific Ocean.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DP:</strong> What is one thing you want Princeton as a community to learn about for Indigenous People's
        Day?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>LB:</strong> Hawai'i is a sovereign nation — the United States illegally overthrew the Hawaiian
        government and annexed Hawai'i.&nbsp;

        <strong>The Daily Princetonian:</strong> Can you describe your Indigenous identity?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rodrigo Córdova-Rosado:</strong> Through my grandmother, I’m a citizen of the Osage Nation, Oklahoma.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DP:</strong> You brought your moccasins with you today. What’s the significance of them to you, in terms
        of Native culture or for the Osage?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>RCR:</strong> For the Osage, like most of the Plains tribes, it’s just about … they’re just shoes.
        They’re just shoes, but I have really come to appreciate them. To an extent it does connect you to an artistry
        and an artisanship of one side of my heritage, and getting to appreciate that through the walk of every day
        really comes to be pretty nice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DP:</strong> What’s one thing you want Princeton to learn, as a community, about what it means to be
        Native?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>RCR:</strong> To be Indigenous is a pretty serious claim about what the nature of our relationship as
        people is, not only to the land, but to the past and in America as a whole. The past is present in a lot of
        ways. There are these consequences that I think we live through today by the nature of how reservations have
        much lower access to health care funding compared to Medicare, compared to other social welfare programs; the
        way that communities still don’t have the same access to education to see themselves in a fast changing world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DP:</strong> Do you think it is students’ responsibility to learn about Indigenous culture and the land
        they’re inhabiting?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>RCR:</strong> It’s certainly not their fault in any way, shape, or form, that they don’t know about
        these things. But it is, I think, a sadness that so few of us know about the history of the continent known as
        the Americas before the Europeans got here. I think it’s unfortunate that we have not cultivated a curiosity for
        learning the history of the land that we consider our right when the history is a little bit more complicated
        than that.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DP</strong>: You’re part of Natives of Princeton ... What is the role of that community in your life
        here?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>RCR:</strong> So far, my relationship with Princeton has been one of connecting with a community that I
        didn’t have access to when I was in the UK, and a community that I didn’t really have access to when I was in
        Puerto Rico. I guess it’s been quite nice to see students who are thinking through these ideas of, “what does
        indigeneity mean in a world that is predominantly not learning about Indigenous people?” Being this voice of,
        “What does it mean to be this body within a system that doesn’t necessarily care about me or doesn’t necessarily
        know about this part of me?” has been an interesting twist of my life. Going from interrogating these questions
        personally and without many answers, to now trying to facilitate those questions for others.
